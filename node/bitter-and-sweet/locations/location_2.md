## A Spiritual Brand:

On several occasions, I’ve seen Papyrus used to evoke scriptures, ethereal concepts, hinting at divinity or the ungraspable: it’s on the main signage of the Mystic Journey Bookstore on Abbot Kinney, the branding of The Church of Scientology in Los Feliz, on the questionable guru’s videos in High Maintenance and all around the Holy Grounds coffee shop in Alhambra (not to mention James Cameron’s Avatar…). Interestingly, these applications are very close to the original inspiration for the typeface as its creator [Costello told Fast Company](https://google.com): "I was thinking a lot about the Middle East, then, and Biblical Times, so I was drawing a lot of ligatures and letters with hairline arrangements."

> "Under the snow is a whole secret kingdom, where the smallest forest animals stay safe and warm. You’re skiing over them now."

This book offers readers the chance to identify more strongly with these small, often forgotten animals — and the more a child can identify with the world around them, the more that child has the experience of feeling that the world they inhabit _belongs_ to them. That’s a powerful feeling for a child.
