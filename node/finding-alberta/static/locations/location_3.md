After the exhibition at Tivoli, Alberta and Victorâ€™s guardians were unsure of what to do. The original plan was to send the children back home, but the idea was resisted. So they ended up with a foster mother and attended this school across the street. Kongelige Vajsenhus was for orphans and continues to be a place for vulnerable children. School was not easy. There was poverty, discipline, a new language, and the challenge of fitting in as outsiders. Somehow, Alberta survived here. Years passed. Her mother wrote letters. Press play to hear what she asked in 1911.
