## Tivoli

Tivoli gardens has always been a space for pleasure-seeking. For music, dance, wonder, and play. The summer of 1905 was particularly special. Under the leadership of famous socialite Emma Gad, the Danish Handicraft society prepared an exhibition showcasing the people and cultural products of Denmark’s colonies: Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the West Indies. Alberta and Victor represented St Croix. The two children were popular but provoked mixed reactions from the public. Some said they were smiling and sweet, but others that they screamed and played wildly. Eventually it was decided to put them in a cage, although not on the days that the exhibition’s royal patron, Crown Princess Louise, attended.
