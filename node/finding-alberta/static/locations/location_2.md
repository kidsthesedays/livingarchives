Tivoli gardens has always been a space for pleasure-seeking. For music, dance, wonder, and play. The summer of 1905 was particularly special. Under the leadership of famous socialite Emma Gad, the Danish Handicraft society prepared an exhibition showcasing the people and cultural products of Denmarkâ€™s colonies: Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and what was then known as the Danish West Indies (St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John). Alberta and Victor represented these Caribbean possessions. Far away from home they awaited a daily audience who stopped, stared, and pointed. Reactions from the public were mixed. Some said that they were smiling and sweet, and others that they screamed and played wildly. Eventually it was decided to put them in a cage.
