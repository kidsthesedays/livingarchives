Tivoli gardens has always been a space for pleasure-seeking. For music, dance, wonder, and play. The summer of 1905 was particularly special. Under the leadership of a businessman named Moses Melchior, and famous socialite Emma Gad, the Danish Handicraft society prepared an exhibition showcasing the people and cultural products of Denmarkâ€™s colonies: Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and three islands in the Caribbean (St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John). Alberta and Victor represented St Croix. The two children were popular but provoked mixed reactions from the public. Some said they were smiling and sweet, and others that they screamed and played wildly. Eventually it was decided to put them in a cage. Play the video to find out more about this unusual initiative.
